This project is a high-performance 3D Gravity Simulator built using C++ and OpenGL. It combines classical Newtonian physics with visual representations of General Relativity, allowing users to spawn celestial bodies and observe how they interact and warp the fabric of spacetime.

## Features

* Real-time Gravity Simulation: Uses Newtonian gravitational laws to calculate interactions between multiple bodies based on mass, distance, and velocity.
* General Relativity Visualization: Dynamically deforms a 3D grid using the Schwarzschild radius formula to visualize gravitational wells.
* Dynamic Object Creation:
* Left Click: Spawn a new celestial body.
* Right Click (Hold): Increase the mass of the object during initialization.
* Launch: Release the mouse to set the object in motion.


* Advanced Rendering:
* Glow Shaders: High-mass objects (stars) utilize a specialized fragment shader to simulate thermal radiation/glow.
* Smooth Lighting: Sphere objects feature normalized vector lighting for a realistic 3D appearance.


* Interactive Camera: Full 6-degrees-of-freedom camera movement with adjustable sensitivity and zoom.

## Tech Stack

* Language: C++
* Graphics API: OpenGL (Modern 330 core profile)
* Windowing and Input: GLFW
* Extension Loader: GLEW
* Mathematics: GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)

## Installation and Build

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed on your system:

* GLEW
* GLFW3
* GLM

### Building with GCC/Clang

bash
g++ main.cpp -o gravity_sim -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -lGLU
./gravity_sim



## The Physics Behind the Code

The simulator uses a custom Object class to track physical properties. Spacetime curvature is calculated on the CPU by iterating through every grid vertex and applying a vertical displacement based on the proximity and mass of nearby objects.

Note: For educational purposes, the sizeRatio and gravitational constant G are scaled to allow for observable orbits and "deep" spacetime wells within a standard window view.
